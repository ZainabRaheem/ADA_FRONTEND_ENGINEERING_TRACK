        <h1>I am Zainab Raheem Oluwafunke.</h1>
        <p>
          I am a Front End Engineering Intern in The ADA Software Engineering
          Program. And this is my second assignment.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am in this program so that I can end the mediocrity in my tech
          journey. I hope to be "Junior developer role ready" at the end of this
          program.
        </p>
        <p>Food is the one thing that puts me in the happiest mood.</p>
        <p>
          A Kitten (below is an image) is beautiful but I find its clingy
          behavior really annoying, ironic because I can be a really clingy
          human around the humans I love. You can think of this as a fun fact,
          Lol.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h2>Below are a list of my hobbies:</h2>
        <span
          >I just do <strong>things</strong> as I enjoy them at the
          moment.</span
        >

        <ul>
          <li>I think I like to drive</li>
          <li>I enjoy reading books that don't make me bored</li>
          <li>
            I love organizing because I love feeling like I am in a clean place,
            organizing brings that feeling.
          </li>
          <li>
            I am certain of these but I don't know what others could be, maybe I
            will think about them and update this list later. <br />
            Bye.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Below is a way I make toast:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Cut peppers and onions, fry sliced sausages with pepper and onions
          </li>
          <li>Boil eggs then slice them</li>
          <li>Slice bread and butter the bread</li>
          <li>Fill bread with sausage mix and sliced eggs</li>
          <li>Put bread in a toaster and wait for toasted bread</li>
        </ol>
