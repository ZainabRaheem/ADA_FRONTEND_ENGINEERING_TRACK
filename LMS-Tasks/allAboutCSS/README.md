This task was assigned so we can work with the knowledge we have acquired from the ALL ABOUT CSS lesson.

Here, I have used an external styling sheet which was linked to with the HTML file.

I used all of the selectors mentioned in the lesson.

From the header and footer tags, there are "a" tags with the target attributes and I used the attribute selector to specifically style these tags.
