This task was assigned so we can work with the knowledge we have acquired from the ALL ABOUT CSS lesson.

Here, I have used an external styling sheet which was linked to with the HTML file.

I used all of the selectors mentioned in the lesson.

From the header and footer tags, there are "a" tags with the target attributes and I used the "attribute selector" to specifically style these tags.

There is a div that houses the entire content of the page, this div has an id of content and I used the "id selector" to style this div.

I used the "pseudo element seletor" to increase the font-size of the first letter in the HURRAY! word. I used the "element selector" to change the color of the exclamation mark when it is hovered over, used an HEX Value color representation

I selected some elements directly, like the h1, ul, li tags

I used the "class selector" for a whole lot of other stylings.

I used a combination selector to style the "a" tag I have in the footer section
